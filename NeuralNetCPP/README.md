# Neural Net C++

Description: Implement a very simple neural network in C++.

### To make the data:
1) Compile the make-training-data.cpp program in to an executable.
2) Create the /tmp/ folder.
3) Run the make-training-data executable and pipe its output to /tmp/trainingData.txt.

``` ./make-training-data.exe > ./tmp/trainingData.txt ```

### To run the neural network:

1) Compile the neural-net.cpp program into an executable.
2) Run the neural-net executable.

``` ./neural-net.exe ```

### NOTES:

 > A makefile has been provided for compiling the programs into executables and cleaning the directory.
